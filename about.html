          Hello there! Thanks for visiting my site on all things baseball. If there is anything I love more than New York bagels, 
          it has to be sitting down to watch the Amazins' (aka the Mets) with my dad on a warm summer night.
          I have also been attending Mets games since I was eight years old, and have been to 14 major league stadiums.
          Before that, I attended Somerset Patriots games, which is now a minor league affiliate of the Yankees.
      </p>

          The purpose of this site is to compile stats on my favorite teams and players, and present them in a way that is useful.
          I live and breath batting average, slugging percentage, RBIs, and on-base percentage, 
          although I am not a fan of advanced stats. You will find stats on some of the best players in the game on the Players page, 
          and this is updated daily.
          On the Teams page, you will find teams' current win and loss records ordered by 2021 winning percentage, as well as top performers.
      </p>

        If you would like to contact me about any of the stats on this site, or you just want to talk about baseball, 
        please use the contact form below.
