            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The About page details the reasons for why I wish to share my baseball knowledge with the world, and present it in a way that is useful and intuitive. It also provides a way to contact me if you believe any of the information is incorrect or you just want to talk baseball. I am always up for a discussion on what are the greatest needs the Mets have, and the ways I would fix their defensive woes.</p>

            <h2>Players</h2>
            <p>The Players page is a collection of baseball cards that contain pictures, a bio, and statistics for the last five games for nine of the best players in the MLB. These are not your grandfather's baseball cards; unlike a paper card, these cards bring you the most up-to-date information, so you know exactly if this player is living up to his billing. I unfortunately had to include one Yankees player, but I wasn't happy about it.</p>

            <h2>Teams</h2>
            <p>Head to the Teams page if you want to see how your team stacks up to each of the other 29 MLB clubs, as well as its current record and place in the division standings. Each team's position on the page is determined based on winning percentage, so you'll know exactly if your team is headed for a breakout season or is at the bottom of the cellar.</p>
